For this Project, Eric Droegemeier, Jenetty Immaraj, and I analyzed data on historical donation data. We then created several predicted models and compared which model performed the best.We then used the best performing model to predict which former donors to target to maximize donor dollars for the next donation marketing campaign. For this project, we used SAS Enterprise Miner.
