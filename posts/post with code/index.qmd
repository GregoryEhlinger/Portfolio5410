For this Project, Jenetty Immaraj and I analyzed the first 18 years of LeBron James's NBA Career. We created a Tableau dashboard to visualize various statistics for each year. Visualizations include profile photo and jerseys, biometrics, statistical averages, shot selection, and geolocation for recorded statistics.
