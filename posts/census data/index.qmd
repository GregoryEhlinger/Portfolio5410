For this Project, Eric Droegemeier, Tserendulam Ichinnorov, Paloma Leonato, Brad Reese and I analyzed the census data for the state of Texas in 2021. We specifcally wanted to compare the income and employment of workers who were foreign-born to those of workers born in the United States. For this project, we used Google Cloud Services, Tableau, and Python.
